"""
TimeGAN:
- A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed for synthetic time series generation.
- Consists of generator and discriminator networks with an embedded encoder-decoder structure.
- Captures temporal dependencies and complex patterns in sequential data.
- Can also be adapted for anomaly detection by evaluating the likelihood of generated samples.

Key Concepts:
- GAN Framework: Uses adversarial learning with a generator and discriminator.
- Temporal Dependencies: Models sequential patterns in data.
- Embedding Network: Learns latent representations of time series data for better generation.

Advantages:
- Generates realistic time series data.
- Captures both temporal and feature-level dependencies.
- Useful for anomaly detection and data augmentation.

Applications:
- Synthetic data generation for imbalanced datasets.
- Anomaly detection in sequential data.
- Financial time series modeling and forecasting.
